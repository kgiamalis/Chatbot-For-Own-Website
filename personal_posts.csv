https://kgiamalis.co/blog/code-anomaly-detection, Anomaly detection algorithm ,"Anomaly detection algorithm  Anomaly detection is a data-driven concept that is widely used by businesses across industries in order to identify potential anomalies in a performance of a product. The concept applies in multiple situations, from fraud detection, to performance monitoring, budget optimization etc.  For this demonstration, we'll be using a simple dataset and the Prophet algorithm. Its not a pure anomaly detection algorithm but it can serve this purpose too. We'll work with a dataset detailing prices for various fuel types. You can download it from this website (from the 1st table).   We'll be using a Collab notebook, so there's no need to download any additional tools to run the provided code.  Run the code on your own, adjust the interval_width and check the different results that will be generated. Also, try to expand the capabilities of Prophet or try other algorithms (like Luminaire) to get a better understanding of how anomaly detection works.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/did-you-just-join-a-company-read-this, Outwork everyone,"Outwork everyone Recently, I found myself engaged in a thought-provoking discussion with a close friend of mine, Harris. We were contemplating, hypothetically, our next professional step.  More specifically, we focused on how an individual can maintain superior quality and high standards in their work when stepping into a new organization.  Having spent eight years at efood, I have accumulated a vast amount of contextual knowledge and experience. Naturally, this puts any newcomer, no matter how competent, at a relative disadvantage. It may even seem unfair.  We came with a conclusion. The best way to uphold high standards as a newcomer is not just to work hard, work smart or both.  The best way is to outwork everyone.  Let me clarify, this is not about competition. Outworking others does not imply measuring their working hours of others and then merely adding a bit more to it. It's also not about simply being a hard worker since it does not necessarily means more working hours. Last but not least, this is the best way, not the only way.  Outworking is a mindset.  It begins with outworking yourself.  Outworking is hard, hence the competition is low. Outworking isn't about office politics. It's purely about the work you produce. Outworking is not luck. You can’t control luck (you can only nudge it). Outworking is correlated with high quality deliverables & deep work. Outworking is about being both passionate and disciplined professional.  If you have the mindset of outworking, your effort will definitely will be worthwhile, regardless the result.  It may not sound glamorous. Some might perceive it as potentially toxic (though I assure you, it is not), or even dismiss it as a cliché.  However, the truth remains - outworking is the best way forward, at least for everyone that want to thrive.  Last note: Outworking does not mean no-life.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/the-okrs-paradox, The OKRs paradox,"The OKRs paradox I use the OKRs method for planning in the last 9 years. So far, I have used them in Marketing, Product and Ops teams.  We tried several approaches and currently but what we observed is the following: There are Objectives that we heavily worked on, without moving the needle. There are Key Results that were achieved, without developing not a single Product commitment.   This is happening, simply because in the online marketplace industry, our Product is our business, which makes the process of matching objectives & key results, very challenging. Here are some real-life examples:  The solution we currently deploy on this paradox, is that in some OKRs, we do not add performance data, but we use “deliverable” data. Let me clarify: Let’s say that we want to develop a new feature that requires 10 new development changes in the platform in order to go live. On our OKRs process, we describe what are we trying to build, why are we trying to build it -without clarifying performance numbers- and the number of deliverables that should be implemented to go live. With this approach, we evaluate our OKRs, based on the deliverables and not on performance.  One note here is that it’s very tempting to switch all Product OKRs to this approach. After all, we worked very hard to develop the feature, isn’t this enough? No. It’s not. Remember, delivering projects and features in only half the job of a PM. A competent Product team should deliver business value and optimal user experience, in a timely manner, using the right technology approach.  OKRs is about WHY, WHAT & WHEN, don’t skip any part of it. Most of the professionals out there are using the OKRs framework and I’m sure that they have the same problems.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/the-first-pm, The first PM,"The first PM Today, I had a conversation with another product manager about the experience of being the first PM. While I wasn't the inaugural PM at efood (that was Jason), I did get involved with the product at an early stage. At Instacar, I was the first hands-on PM consultant. Every popular app or online service we use today, regardless of its size, started with a small team of engineers and a first PM. Many companies have CEOs who built the initial product from scratch, as was the case with efood. Nevertheless, the first PM was always close to this stage. Moving from zero to one is one of the most challenging stages in product development. The development uncertainty, the volume and complexity of decisions, and the absence of structure can make this journey quite a roller-coaster ride. In an environment where there is no established rulebook, the first PM must operate without the advantage of set documentation and procedures. Their approach is more practical and agile, always ready to adapt and pivot as required.   Their experiences, including both failures and successes, form a solid foundation of knowledge that can guide future PMs and other professionals in the field. Therefore, it is beneficial to seek them out, engage with them, and ask them questions. You might gain insights that could help your product become the next big thing.  It's all about managing the chaos, thriving in uncertainty, and having the foresight to build from nothing to something.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/experience-shocks-vs-years, Experience: shocks vs years,"Experience: shocks vs years We were discussing the concept of professional experience with Michalis Konstantoulakis today and what the correct way to evaluate a potential candidate is. Neither of us is a fan of just counting years of experience, simply because this metric severely lacks business context, even if the candidate's CV includes performance metrics. To me, the combination of professional ""shocks"" with years of experience in competent positions is the right mix when it comes to evaluating someone.  If I had to choose only one though, I would choose shocks.  Examples of Professional ""Shocks"":  As a note, you can see that I don't necessarily describe a successful experience here, since we mainly evaluate the experience of a shock, rather than the result.  We are actively searching for individuals who have experienced these shocks in their professional journey and have somehow managed to successfully cope with them.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/book-review-mastery, Path to mastery,"Path to mastery Recently, I finished reading the book ""Mastery"" by Robert Greene. Greene is an intriguing author, somewhat controversial, with a mix of supporters and critics. In this book, he outlines the three phases someone should follow to attain mastery—the sense of having more control over reality, others, and ourselves.  According to his theory, there are three distinct phases or levels to achieve mastery:  1st: Apprenticeship Stand on the outside of the field, absorbing as much as you can about the basic elements and rules. The principle is simple: the goal of an apprenticeship isn't money, a good position, or title, but rather the transformation of your mind and character. It's the first step on the journey to mastery.  2nd: Creative-active Through extensive practice and immersion, we gain insight into the inner workings, how things connect, and thus understand the subject more comprehensively.  3rd: Mastery This phase involves the ability to experiment and creatively play with the elements involved. Our knowledge, experience, and focus become so profound that we can see the entire picture with complete clarity.  Besides the mastery process, there's a dedicated chapter about mentorship, discussing its importance, finding the right mentor, and maximizing a mentorship.  Additionally, there's a chapter about social intelligence and the ability to read people, understand their worldview, and recognize their individuality. In my view, this is the most compelling chapter of the book, encompassing strategies like:  The book is filled with fascinating stories from influential personalities like Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Marcel Proust, illustrating how they achieved their mastery.  Some of book’s highlights:  I found the book interesting for a couple of reasons: Firstly, the process that is dealing with is an interesting open-ended framework that is close to reality. You can’t become a master without acquiring and mastering the right skills. Moreover, I appreciated the analogies between the process and the stories of influential individuals. This connection can help readers understand how the framework aided them and how it might assist others. Lastly, the section on social intelligence was intriguing, offering valuable insights and tips on dealing with people effectively.  I recommend this book to those beginning their professional journey, as well as experienced individuals who may be struggling to unlock their mastery phase.  PS: It comes in a concise edition too.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/simple-prioritization-framework, Simple prioritization framework,"Simple prioritization framework There are many prioritization frameworks available. My personal favorite is RICE, which is recognized as an industry standard in product management. However, RICE has certain prerequisites that must be met before implementation. One of the simplest and most effective frameworks to use involves choosing only two from the following: 💡 If you're aiming for product-market fit, focus on speed and cost-efficiency. 💡 Once you've found market fit, aim for speed and quality. This might need funding or cash flow, as it won't be a low-cost option. 💡 If you're a large corporation, opting for low cost isn't viable due to labor costs and opportunity costs. The decision then boils down to either fast or good. 💡 When running an experiment, speed and cost-efficiency should be your priorities. 💡 If you face intense competition, quality should be your default choice. Often, speed also becomes a necessity, but this will require cash flow as it won't come cheap. 💡 If you are building a major feature for your product, fast is not an option. You need to do it good and it will be expensive, especially if it requires heavy product development.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/skills-versus-luck, Skills versus luck,"Skills versus luck I recently came across a fascinating lesson in a book I read. This lesson, applicable to both work and life, is best illustrated through the story of Nick the Greek, a renowned gambler in the United States. It's estimated that he won and lost over 500 million dollars throughout his life, ultimately dying penniless.  Nick the Greek had an unconventional approach to poker. He believed that a pair of aces were the worst hand, while a 7-2 hand was the best. This strategy is the exact opposite of what is generally accepted in poker.  Whenever he won using his strategy, he would think, ""What a great strategy,"" but when he lost, he would chalk it up to bad luck. In reality, the opposite was true!    Let’s check the scenarios based on Nick the Greek story:  And then comes the trickiest and most beautiful part of life:  What are we going to do in a situation that requires both skills and luck?

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/essay-a-strange-ab-test, [Essay] A strange A/B test,"[Essay] A strange A/B test Various methods are employed to cross-check the efficiency of tools and data health. These include the test traffic feature in Google Analytics, the sandbox environment in Adjust (for app tracking), and A/A tests in Optimizely.  However, how do we handle advertising platforms? Advertising platforms operate on a pay-to-play basis. We validate conversions and clicks from all ads within Google Analytics as a single source of truth, but what about other metrics that are specific to ad platforms?  In 2016, we aimed to understand how creatives influence the assisted conversion types of ad platforms. Some might argue that a test not focused on conversions is pointless, but assisted conversions are part of the conversion flow, and as marketing attribution models and conversion windows are not particularly ""glamorous.” This is the lookback period after people view your ad, during which you attribute action-based results (such as clicks and conversions) to that ad. AdWords: View-through Conversion This is the period of time after an impression, during which a view-through conversion is recorded. View-through conversions occur when the user doesn’t interact with the ad but later converts. We decided to carry out an unconventional test.  The A/B test was not designed to identify the winning variation but to establish the benchmark of advertising assisted conversions. How can we set the benchmark for this test? We need a variation with a creative and a variation without one, which isn't feasible. We used two variations of ""empty"" banners that contain no information about the advertised company, efood, and look like generic placeholders. Then, there are two variations of ""branded"" banners, one featuring food and one displaying an animal. The test took place on the Google Display Network (GDN). We chose GDN because ""empty"" banners would be irrelevant in the context of Facebook ads, as they include the advertiser's logo and name, making them appear more like errors than tests.  Here were the results from the GDN test: It's important to note that our intent was not to construct a tightly controlled A/B test in a laboratory setting. Instead, we aimed to design something meaningful for us, capable of generating sufficient traction to produce data worthy of analysis.  After running the campaign for a week, the results were as follows: To sum up: The table above reveals a couple of insights: 💡 CTR & Clicks CTR and clicks were significantly higher for empty banners. We don't have a clear explanation for this; perhaps users found the unusualness of the empty banners intriguing, generating more clicks (and consequently, CTR). Surprisingly, the low-performance audience outperformed the high-performance audience in both variations.  💡 View-through Conversions View-through conversions were also substantially higher. One logical observation is that the high-performance audience generated more view-throughs.  💡 Audience Performance The low-performance audience generated more clicks, while the high-performance audience yielded better outcomes. The volume of clicks generated by the low-performance audience in both empty and branded banners variations is puzzling, though the better outcomes in the high-performance group require no further explanation.  💡 Animal vs Food The animal banner significantly outperformed the food banner. It seems a squirrel can indeed beat a pizza!  After this test, we didn't dedicate all our GDN budget to empty banners. We didn't shift the entire budget to another platform either. Instead, we adjusted our ad strategy and gained confidence to invest more in ad A/B testing.

I read this post today and I immediately skip my regular music playlist and start listening to 40Hz binaural beats for more than 4 hours.  I won’t say that it increased my focus dramatically but somehow it helped (it might be placebo though). It’s kind of weird sound, try it (headphones only) and you will understand why, it’s not a typical sound that you are used to listen, when you work. After the first hour (it took me a while to get comfortable with it) this type of sound managed to eliminate every other sound existed in my environment and it did not distract me as well.  I am not 100% that I will stick to it, but I will try to have it as a first option, every time I have to do deep work.

Topics like Apple's Vision Pro, AI, Tesla, Neuralink, the Metaverse, Cryptos and the list goes on… All those mentioned above are indeed innovative projects and concepts. They disrupt large, traditional industries and have the potential to reshape the global economic landscape if they scale.  I want to take a different approach to discussing innovation by describing the story of a particular invention. This is a simple yet innovative product that is used 96 million times per day, ONLY in Great Britain. The invention is based on the second most widely consumed drink in the world (water being the first):   Yes, the ones we use to drink our tea.  Teabags are considered one of the greatest inventions due to their widespread use across the world. Commercial production started in the 1920s, and they were initially available in two sizes: a larger bag for the teapot and a smaller one for the cup. Their primary Unique Selling Proposition (USP) is the same as what we still find in most successful companies today. It's also the primary USP for e-food:  Convenience.  Teabags provide a convenient way to drink your tea, as you don't need to remove the tea leaves from your cup.  Teabag production has undergone many optimizations (such as becoming plastic-free, heat-sealed, affordable on a mass scale, etc.) in order to reach the final version that we have today. But the moral of this invention is what I appreciate most and what I currently embrace:  Innovation does not always have to be complex or high-tech. Many of the most impactful inventions are those that simplify or enhance our daily routines in some way.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/awareness-test, Awareness test,"Awareness test Here is a 15-year-old (but useful) test about awareness. I don’t want to spoil it for you, so please check the video first and then read the rest of the article.  Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSQJP40PcGI   The reason I find this video very helpful is that, especially when it comes to analytical thinking & decision making, there are many biases. Even after creating a detailed analysis or getting a sophisticated decision, we might still be blind and miss the obvious things.  I've shown this test to many people, yet only a few managed to spot the bear. Almost everyone managed to count the passes correctly, though.  There are many times I see analyses that seem right but still didn't manage to answer important questions.  Similarly, we might check a ton of parameters of a project but we managed to miss some of the most important ones.   Why is that happening? Here are a couple of reasons: One of the most popular complex examples in the business world is how to measure incrementality. Your feature might generate thousands of interactions and conversions, but are those conversions incremental? A simple question with a complex answer. There are many ways to measure incrementality. A common one is controlled experiments & holdout groups, but they require an initial setup. If you miss that setup, you can’t use them. If you missed setting up controlled experiments, causal impact is a statistical method developed by Google. It can be useful to measure incrementality, from product features to marketing campaigns & sales efforts.  Imagine that you spent a significant amount of time building a feature, or you used a large portion of your marketing budget on a campaign. Your investment isn't only resource-based; it's emotional too. Unconsciously, you'll try to find ways and metrics to prove to yourself and others that this initiative worked. In cases of great success or failure, things are straightforward, but most initiatives are not outliers.  A common bias for everyone. As humans, we tend to seek, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. Even if you're data-driven, the vast array of available metrics can be misleading. You might cherry-pick those that confirm your bias and make a decision that feels data-driven, even if it's not. There's a relevant quote from British economist Ronald Coase: “If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.”  Your expertise can sometimes make you blind, as you might focus only on what you know and inadvertently overlook other crucial aspects that fall outside your scope. A prime example of this is when one evaluates the success of a feature while completely neglecting user incentive campaigns. This oversight can happen simply because you might not be aware of the active campaigns, especially if campaigns are handled by the Marketing team, while product features are developed by the Product team.  Lastly, the organizational hierarchy plays a role. When a CEO or C-level executive makes a request, it carries more weight than a regular stakeholder's request. Our attention tends to shift towards expedient delivery (e.g., ""as soon as possible"" or ""needed yesterday"") rather than a comprehensive review and analysis of the situation.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/how-to-do-great-work, How to do great work,"How to do great work I've recently read Paul Graham's latest essay on how to accomplish great work. His essays are always insightful, and I encourage everyone to read as many of them as possible.  paulgraham.com Paul Graham argues that great work happens at the intersection of three things: what you're good at, what you care about, and what the world needs. He also discusses some of the challenges of doing great work, such as the need for focus, the importance of perseverance, and the risk of failure. Graham begins by defining great work as ""work that matters, work that's worth doing."" He argues that great work is not about being the best at something, but about finding something that you're good at and that you care about, and then doing it as well as you can. He also says that great work is not always easy, but it is always worth it. Graham then goes on to discuss the three things that need to intersect in order for great work to happen: Graham concludes by saying that great work is not always easy, but it is always worth it. He says that great work can give you a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, and it can make a real difference in the world. In addition to the three things mentioned by Graham, I would add that great work also requires creativity, innovation, and a willingness to take risks. Great work is not about following the status quo. It's about challenging the status quo and finding new and better ways of doing things. If you're looking to do great work, I encourage you to reflect on the three things that Graham mentions in his article. What are you good at? What do you care about? What does the world need? Once you've answered these questions, you'll be well on your way to doing great work. Since this particular article is quite lengthy, consisting of 11,000 words, I understand that not everyone may have the time or inclination to read it in its entirety. Therefore, I've gathered the key points: First step: decide what to work on - Something you have a natural aptitude for - Something you have deep interest in - Something that offers scope to do great work The way to figure out what to work on is by working. Develop a habit, working on your own projects. What kind of projects? The ones that seem to you excitingly ambitious. Excited curiosity: What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for. Four steps: 1. Choose a field, 3. Learn enough to get to the frontier, (requires hard work) 3. Notice gaps, 4. Explore promising ones. (requires hard work) This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists. 3 most powerful motives: Curiosity Delight Desire to do something impressive When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. That's the key: consistency If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work. The route to great work is never easy. You may have to throw things away and redo them. Have the confidence to cut. Great ideas have to be true and new. Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. Curiosity and originality are closely related. One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. A good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. Being prolific is underrated. The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know what you don't have to worry about. Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. And don't take rejection by committees to heart. Work with people you want to become like, because you will. Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to ""Never give up"" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. An audience is a critical component of morale. People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. The opinion of people you respect is signal. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on ""curiosity."" Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match between the current version of you and a list of known problems.

So when I go to the dressing room at half-time, I spend 14 minutes of the 15 speaking only for Mario. ""Mario I cannot change you. I cannot make a change. I don't have a striker on the bench. Don't touch anybody. Play only with the ball. When we lose the ball, no reaction. If somebody provokes you, no reaction. If the referee makes a mistake, no reaction. Mario, please. But, Mario, who was only 19 years old then, got another yellow card and was removed from the game in the 60th minute.  What's the lesson? Mourinho knew Mario might get into trouble, so he used the whole break to talk only to him. It was the right call.  But even though Mourinho made a good decision, things didn't go well. So, what happens when you do the right thing, but it still goes wrong?  This is not rare. There is a fallacy called “resulting” which is dangerous since it prevents us from properly evaluating whether we're making good decisions, because we tie our decisions solely with their outcomes. Sometimes we win or lose by factors we can't control, regardless of the decision we made. For these reasons, we need to understand that our end results alone don't tell us the whole story, whether we're good making good decisions.  Here is a chart the describes combinations between outcomes and process behind them.  The combination of “good process + bad outcome” is the most challenging one.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/what-to-read, How I choose what to read,"How I choose what to read When it comes to reading content, what and how do you read? I discussed this with Tom Papaspyros, an avid reader, and he proposed a helpful approach that he uses too. So, here are two methods: the one discussed with Tom and the one I currently employ. Tom proposed this approach to reading. If you're unsure which books to choose, reach out to an expert for suggestions. If no expert is available, opt for bestsellers. By reading 2-3 books that focus on your problem, you will gain concentrated knowledge in that area. Don't misunderstand me; reading three books is not easy, but it will provide rich information about the problem that interests you. When you're searching for a solution to a problem, avoid aimless browsing on the web. Instead, select carefully a couple of experts whom you believe offer valuable insights and consider their opinions on your issue. For instance, when it comes to Google Analytics, I exclusively read Avinash Kaushik's blog (avinash.net). For Tag Manager, I only read Simo Ahava's work. As for marketing strategy, I consume content written by Seth Godin (actually I don’t read anymore about Marketing but I used to read a lot). The reason is simple. An expert possesses a comprehensive way of thinking and doing things. His approach is based on processes that he uses for years. The follow their principles and the things they believe. By extracting insights from their minds and adding your thoughts, you can create something more robust compared to just reading the first result from a Google search. However, this requires that the expert shares your fundamental principles, otherwise you will develop something robust but wrong. Hence, choosing the right expert is crucial. Disclaimer: You can read content from other experts, but I suggest a ratio of 80% from your chosen expert and 20% from different experts. When it comes to product development, I follow Lenny's newsletter & Shreyas Doshi for regular content reading. These two sources cover almost everything I need. If I require additional insight, I consult other experts too, such as Casey Winters & Brian Balfour.

A few years ago, I was part of the Marketing team. Now, I find myself in the Product department. From my perspective, I've had the opportunity to work with some of the most limited resources in a company:  However, this post touches on what I believe to be the most significant constraint: Time.  There is an intriguing theory named ""The Tail End"" which dives deep into this very concept. I came across a fascinating article about it on a blog called ""Wait But Why"" (I'll share the link at the end).  Here's a brief overview of ""The Tail End"":  Having relocated to another city or perhaps even a different country, your meetings with him are limited. You manage to spend only around 30 days with him each year. These are distributed as 8 days during Christmas, 8 days over Easter, 8 days in summer, and the remaining days scattered throughout the year for occasions like birthdays or adhoc visits.  The average life expectancy in Greece for men stands at 79.8 years. To make calculations easier let’s make it 80.  By this logic, you'd have 600 days left (30 days annually plus the 20 years he has from the age of 60 to 80) with your father. And it's essential to remember, once a day goes by, it doesn't return.  600 days are less than 2 years. We’re in the tail end.  The article shared some startling insights: By the time we finish high school, we’ve already used up about 93% of our face-to-face time with our father. Presently, we're relishing the last 7%. We’re in the tail end.  It might come across as slightly grim, but it’s an undeniable truth. The central message of the article is the following: Life's brevity means that setting priorities and valuing quality time is of utmost importance.  You can read it here: No matter what your age, you may, without realizing it, be enjoying the very last chapter of the relationships that matter most to you.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/perfect-conversion, Flawed conversions,"Flawed conversions Every quarter, or sometimes every two, we explore the development of new metrics that aren't found in our standard product management reporting or official business reports. These metrics are specific to our business and assist us in identifying patterns in the hypotheses we form over time.  In this post, I'll discuss a metric we've developed and use, called ""flawless conversion."" Definition: ""Flawless conversion is a session where the user converted without experiencing any flaws.”  Methodology:  One crucial step is defining the events that will be considered as flawed ones. We mapped the entire user flow and divided the flawed events into two categories: Hard events are those that prevent progression to the conversion funnel or create a very negative user experience (UX), while soft events negatively affect the experience but don't block the conversion funnel. We began with hard events, as they have the most significant negative impact on user flow. Hard event examples: login.failed: User failed to login (segmented per login type). payment.failed: User failed to pay (segmented per payment type). order.cancelled: Order cancelled (segmented per cancellation type).  Another vital element is understanding why we developed this metric. We did so to quantitatively assess whether our product's user experience is satisfactory. Though we have metrics for events that negatively affect users, we lacked a way to link successful transactions segmented with negative events—until now.  The goal of this metric is to be as minimal as possible, reflecting a perfect conversion UX without any adverse UX events.  This metric does have limitations. For instance, it only examines successful sessions leading to conversion, not all sessions, and we can't measure all the hard events we'd like to (e.g., ""app.crashed,"" meaning the app crashed) due to technical constraints.  Do you think this metric is helpful or not?  How would you expand it?  Are you aware of how many of your transactional sessions include negative UX events?

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/why-you-should-read-books, Why you should read books,"Why you should read books As someone who loves reading books, I have discovered two significant benefits that go beyond (the obvious of) acquiring knowledge.  Reading a book is like giving your brain a workout, especially when it comes to focus. Unlike multitasking, you can't read and do something else at the same time.  To truly understand and absorb what you're reading, you need to concentrate.  In a world where distractions are everywhere, cultivating the ability to focus has become increasingly important. In today's professional landscape, many struggle with maintaining sustained attention. However, reading provides an effective remedy. By engaging with the written word, you train your mind to concentrate deeply, improving your ability to stay focused on tasks and boosting overall productivity. Reading books is a fantastic way to enhance your writing skills.  When you read well-structured, valuable content, you subconsciously absorb the principles of good writing. This exposure to different writing styles and genres allows you to internalize the art of effective storytelling. Writing is an undervalued yet very important skill in today's modern world, regardless of your profession.  It goes beyond copywriters and applies to fields like product management, marketing, and general business communication. Every day, we write emails, reports, and chat conversations.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/chatgpt4-system-card, ChatGPT4 system card,"ChatGPT4 system card I've thoroughly studied the system card for ChatGPT-4 today. It consists of 30 pages of core content, complemented by an additional 30 pages of appendix and citations. This in-depth exploration has  helped me understand how it actually works, its limitations, and challenges.  If you're in the Product/Tech sector, I highly recommend diving into the system cards of any LLM models you intend to use.  System card of ChatGPT4: cdn.openai.com  Here is a quick summary: The ChatGPT system card is a document that describes the safety risks associated with the GPT-4 language model. It discusses the potential for GPT-4 to generate harmful content, such as hate speech, discriminatory language, and incitements to violence. It also warns that GPT-4 can represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the user's intent, or of widely shared values.  The system card also describes the safety mitigations that OpenAI has implemented to reduce the risk of harm from GPT-4. These mitigations include:  The system card concludes by stating that GPT-4 is still under development, and that OpenAI is committed to continuing to research and improve its safety. The most important aspects of the ChatGPT system card are: I hope this summary is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Other important notes: GPT models are often trained in two stages:  First, they are trained, using a large dataset of text from the Internet, to predict the next word. The models are then fine-tuned with additional data, using an algorithm called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to produce outputs that are preferred by human labelers. Fine-tuning has made these models more controllable and useful. In most cases, GPT-4-launch exhibits much safer behavior due to the safety mitigations we applied. We found that GPT-4-early and GPT-4-launch exhibit many of the same limitations as earlier language models, such as producing biased and unreliable content. Red teaming in general, and the type of red teaming we call ’expert red teaming, is just one of the mechanisms[27] we use to inform our work identifying, measuring, and testing AI systems. GPT-4-launch scores 19 percentage points higher than our latest GPT-3.5 model at avoiding open-domain hallucinations, and 29 percentage points higher at avoiding closed-domain hallucinations. While our testing effort focused on harms of representation rather than allocative harms, it is important to note that the use of GPT-4 in contexts such as making decisions or informing decisions around allocation of opportunities or resources requires careful evaluation of performance across different groups. Our red teaming results suggest that GPT-4 can rival human propagandists in many domains, especially if teamed with a human editor. Red teamers selected a set of questions to prompt both GPT-4 and traditional search engines, finding that the time to research completion was reduced when using GPT-4. The impact of GPT-4 on the economy and workforce should be a crucial consideration for policymakers and other stakeholders. Over time, we expect GPT-4 to impact even jobs that have historically required years of experience and education, such as legal services. However, even using AI as a productivity multiplier requires workers to adjust to new workflows and augment their skills. One concern of particular importance to OpenAI is the risk of racing dynamics leading to a decline in safety standards, the diffusion of bad norms, and accelerated AI timelines, each of which heighten societal risks associated with AI. We refer to these here as ""acceleration risk.""24 This was one of the reasons we spent six months on safety research, risk assessment, and iteration prior to launching GPT-4.2. Overreliance occurs when users excessively trust and depend on the model, potentially leading to unnoticed mistakes and inadequate oversight. To tackle overreliance, we’ve refined the model’s refusal behavior, making it more stringent in rejecting requests that go against our content policy, while being more open to requests it can safely fulfill. One objective here is to discourage users from disregarding the model’s refusals. Deployment preparation (p.21 -very interesting section) RLHF fine-tuning makes our models significantly safer. We’ve decreased the models tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content by 82% compared to GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 responds to sensitive requests (e.g. medical advice and self-harm) in accordance with our policies 29% more often. For tackling open-domain hallucinations, we collect real-world ChatGPT data that has been flagged by users as being not factual, and collect additional labeled comparison data that we use to train our reward models. For closed-domain hallucinations, we are able to use GPT-4 itself to generate synthetic data. Moderation classifiers play a key role in our monitoring and enforcement pipeline. We are constantly developing and improving these classifiers. Several of our moderation classifiers are accessible to developers via our Moderation API endpoint, which enables developers to filter out harmful content while integrating language models into their products.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/user-acquisition-kpi-2, User acquisition KPI #2,"User acquisition KPI #2 Continuing the series on user acquisition KPIs, I want to introduce a metric that might not be widely recognized but can serve as a valuable health indicator. This calculated metric offers insight into the experience of a new user and, in our particular situation, could reveal underlying product or business issues.  KPI: Percentage of user acquisitions that signed up and converted within the same day, referred to as ""single touch acquisitions.""  Definition: New users who registered and placed their first order on our platform within the same day.  Why it matters: The online food delivery marketplace is an industry that typically is high-intent and it involves immediate decisions. Most of the time, users who land on our platform are hungry and eager to order. Industries that cater to urgent needs often generate high user conversion rates, so we've found that the proportion of people who sign up and order within the same day is a valuable health indicator. A low percentage of single touch acquisitions could signal a poor user experience. This might be due to a variety of reasons, such as technical downtime or supply issues like closed shops, limited offers, or marketing campaigns promoting something that's already expired. It's different to generate 1,000 acquisitions with 1,200 signups compared to generating 1,000 acquisitions with 4,000 signups. The end result may be the same, but the share of single touch acquisitions varies significantly.  Challenges: Some teams promote and even incentivize signups on their platforms, although the reason for doing so might not always be clear. A marketing campaign focused on this can negatively impact this KPI. This metric emphasizes a specific time window that might not apply to every business. For example, if you run a leasing company, this KPI is unlikely to be relevant (unless you work in instacar 😉). Additionally, a user's order might not necessarily occur within the same session or on the same device as the signup, adding complexity to this measurement.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/know-yourself, Know yourself,"Know yourself My team and I took the PrinciplesYou assessment, which is a free personality test that helps you understand your personality archetype. The test is based on 17 core dimensions of personality, and it takes about 50 minutes to complete. The test results provide a detailed assessment of your thinking style, including your tendencies, talents, and opportunities for growth. You can also see how your personality archetype plays out in real-life situations. I found the PrinciplesYou assessment to be a helpful tool for understanding myself better. I learned about my strengths and weaknesses, and I also gained insights into how I interact with others. However, I believe that it is only half the truth. The best way to understand your personality is to get feedback from others too. This is because we often have blind spots about ourselves, and we can't always see our own strengths and weaknesses clearly. Here is my result: Here are some additional things to consider about the PrinciplesYou assessment: Relevant posts: Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not necessarily express the views or opinions of my employer."
https://kgiamalis.co/blog/a-question-for-analysts, Coding or thinking?,"Coding or thinking? When it comes to product analysts or analysts in general, I've identified a common pattern:  There's an obsession with tools and technology.  Many interviews, jobs, and professionals are focusing on highlighting hard skills.  The same emphasis on tools is seen in educational courses and universities as well. They concentrate solely on how you manipulate data and how to visualize it more effectively.  When it comes to analysis and analysts, there are two essential pillars to consider. The first is technical expertise. You can't be an analyst without a proper technical background.  The second is how you utilize your analytical thinking skills to perform an analysis. ❓How do you break down a problem into smaller parts? ❓How do you deal with the cognitive biases that might occur? (ex. cherry picking) ❓How do you respond to a problem where the only answer is ""I don't know""? ❓How do you ensure that correlation does not imply causation? ❓How do you prioritize objectivity over validation?  This second pillar is often overlooked. I'm not sure why, but there could be several reasons. One reason might be that your company only wants you to extract data from the database (using your technical skills) and then leaves the stakeholder to create the analysis. The question here is whether you want to be that person.  Another reason might be that data is not treated as a priority. That means you only maintain regular data reports that are mostly used for monitoring purposes and not as tools for making decisions that lead to actions.  Look for companies that value your analytical way of thinking. This approach will help you become a better professional, earn more money, and develop analyses that make a real impact.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/growth-metric-1, User acquisition KPI #1,"User acquisition KPI #1 In this series of posts, I'll share some key KPIs (key performance indicators) about user acquisitions. As we already know, not all customers are created equal, so we've invested a significant amount of time and effort to identify the right KPIs. These indicators help us understand the quality of new customers and guide our strategy and budget towards optimal performance. I'll skip the more common ones, such as device, landing page, marketing channel, 1-month cohorts, etc., to focus on those that may not be as popular but are still important. Due to confidentiality, I won't share our specific numbers, but I'll offer some aggregated-level KPIs that I believe are valuable for various consumer products.  KPI: Share of user acquisitions generated through word of mouth (WOM)  Definition: New users who place their first order on our platform and, when asked, “how did you learn about us”, respond with, “a friend told me about your platform.”  To enable this, by the time a new user performs his first order he will see a survey “how did you learn about us” with a list of options that correlate to communication channels, in a randomized way.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/a-hidden-metric, A hidden metric: StDev,"A hidden metric: StDev Here's a useful metric that isn't commonly seen in many reports, even though it can be very insightful. Let's illustrate it with an example. Consider this report showing transaction conversion rates for two months: At first glance, these rates appear nearly identical, don't they? Let's delve a bit deeper: [June 2023] Conversion rate: 14,9% [April 2023] Conversion rate: 14,8% Spot any differences? The distinction lies in the deviation rates for each month. The metric that highlights such patterns and is part of descriptive statistics is called: Let's re-examine the report, this time with the added standard deviation: [June 2023]  Conversion rate: 14,9% Standard deviation: 11,4 [April 2023]  Conversion rate: 14,8% Standard deviation: 3,38 We use standard deviation as a health indicator when analyze large sets of data. A high standard deviation suggests that we might not want to place full trust in a metric because its components vary significantly. On the other hand, a low standard deviation indicates that the metric is consistent and can be deemed reliable. Formula for Standard Deviation for a Sample: There's no one-size-fits-all answer. It varies based on the specific metric in question. Through practice and observation over the years, we’ve identified our own benchmarks. However, our approach is tailored to metrics specific to efood and might not apply universally.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/the-only-rule-that-matters, Care,"Care When we set out to establish our product principles, we had an in-depth discussion about their formation. We agreed to create guiding principles rather than rigid rules, with only one exception. The exception was intended to ensure a non-negotiable aspect that we believed was fundamental to our product development.  The only rule we have is:   We need to care more than anyone else for our team, our Product & our business.  If you don’t care, you will only deliver stakeholder requests. If you don’t care, you will only deliver your requests while ignoring stakeholders. If you don’t care, you will deliver something that you believe that is wrong because someone else believe that it is right.  If you don’t care, you will just follow the process. If you don’t care, you will not respect the process.  If you don’t care, team problems are not your problems. If you don’t care, team problems are your only problems.  If you don’t care, you will use the hierarchy to hide. If you don’t care, you will ignore the hierarchy on your own favor.  Large organizations have significant structural advantages. But the real impacts happen when they act like small ones. This post was inspired by a series of articles from Seth Godin (2005 - 2023): Unless someone does, things start to fray around the edges.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/guide-pm-growth-assessment-example, [Guide] PM Growth assessment example,"[Guide] PM Growth assessment example In this post, I will share an assessment that we used when we were searching for a product manager for our consumer growth initiatives. Consumer growth at efood signifies that the product manager will be accountable for product initiatives and projects that center on user acquisition and retention. Most often, these projects correlate with the user experience on our website and our apps. Even though this assessment is old, it remains relevant. There are many online resources about all things Product Management. Still, I couldn't find many worthwhile public product assessments. I believe that by sharing this, I will help professionals understand what we expect from a Product Manager in charge of our growth projects and the implementation roadmap for our Android & iOS mobile applications. This assessment has four main pillars. We evaluate these pillars separately to obtain the total score. A primary challenge here is not to force the candidate to spend excessive hours of their free time, while not wanting to exclude any of these pillars from the evaluation.  The purpose here is to assess the candidate's thought process, not the length of the deliverable (we even mention this in the small print in the deliverables section). The case is about mobile web. The mobile website of every business is a tricky area. There are numerous examples of poor and best practices, but generally, a website that incorporates the advantages, such as Google's discoverability, and disadvantages, like limited capabilities compared to apps, of web browsers within the small real estate of a smartphone. Mobile web is not dead, and e-commerce businesses that invest in mobile web gain significant value over those that ignore it. This report doesn't allow candidates to delve deeper. It only provides overview data. The reason for this is we want to understand if the candidate can comprehend how Google Analytics works and identify potential challenges and opportunities from this high-level overview. Content group has a specific definition in Google Analytics. Through this report, you can discern which landing page group (which means which product flow) converts better, which group has significant traction and which group has the largest potential.  This report will help the candidate to prioritize their A/B tests efficiently. When candidates ask which specific restaurant’s page they should examine, it is a clear indicator that they are not familiar with how content group functions in Google Analytics. There is no right or wrong approach, as long as you have sound arguments to support it. For example, some candidates might focus on the homepage because it generates the most traction in terms of sessions, so even the smallest increase in CVR will lead to more transactions.  Others might focus on the menu page landing group because the combination of a low bounce rate with a low conversion rate might lead to “easy wins” A/B tests. A small bounce rate indicates that users are attempting to convert, so there must be impediments within the flow preventing user conversion. Product flow optimization varies across industries. Some services don't require account creation for a transaction, while others do. In our case, if you want to place an order online, we need you to create an account and provide us with your delivery address.  As you can see in the report, we're talking about landing pages. A landing page is the page where a user ""lands."" This means the user hasn't seen the flow steps that occur before this landing page. Hence, you should be able to create an account and/or provide your address on every landing page that users ""land"" on the most. The best suggestions focus on how to encourage users to add everything necessary in a smooth and efficient manner. Other good suggestions identify and close the gaps between the restaurant list and restaurant page (e.g., if a restaurant offers loyalty points, it should be highlighted in both the restaurant list and restaurant page). An experienced product manager will check not only the primary path or the ""happy path"" as we define it, but also some other less straightforward paths.  For example, there are suggestions to enhance the restaurant reviews section if a restaurant has excellent reviews. Checking reviews is not mandatory to place an order online, but it can dramatically influence user behavior. When it comes to A/B testing, we mostly consider the ideation process plus the mechanics of the test. Ideation may seem like an easy task. Ideas are everywhere, they're cheap, and there are literally tons of good, bad, unconventional, and innovative ideas available for free. What distinguishes a good candidate is how she selects the ideas that she believes are worth exploring. We've seen a lot of A/B test suggestions that propose bigger copy (order now → ORDER NOW or O R D E R N O W) or changing the color of the Call To Action (CTA) button. We don't favor such suggestions.  This doesn't mean that we don't try these kinds of A/B tests, but we prefer to see something more relevant than an A/B test suggestion that's considered a best practice (some might call it basic). The simplest way to come up with good ideas is to do a brief analysis of the biggest online delivery apps out there. There are fantastic services worldwide that allow you to order food online, such as PedidosYa, Talabat, Foodpanda, Doordash, Zomato, Swiggy, etc.  There's also cross-industry inspiration, where you can generate ideas based on services from other industries like Fintech, Social Media, etc. Prioritization is a hot topic.  It is one of the most crucial skills of every Product Manager.  There are various prioritization methods available; some are popular, some are more ROI-oriented, and some are anti-patterns. Since each method has its advantages and disadvantages, it helps us gain better context regarding a Product Manager's prioritization style.  Some PMs are iteration-oriented (small and fast changes), while others are ROI-oriented (bigger but more impactful changes). Every prioritization method is welcome because, from time to time, we adjust our prioritization schema to meet specific business needs. One argument about prioritization is that, because PMs aren't aware of our Tech stack, they'll mostly fail to predict correctly the effort required for task implementation. Firstly, this applies to all candidates, so it's fair.  Secondly, an experienced PM can understand the difference between the effort required to change the placement of a button and the effort to change the entire product flow. For the record, no excellent assessment lost points due to poor effort estimation.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/attribution-models-beyond-last-click, [Guide] Attribution Models: Beyond Last Click,"[Guide] Attribution Models: Beyond Last Click Table of content Attribution models help assign credit for sales and conversions to touchpoints in conversion paths and they are part of fundamental optimization techniques for marketing channels.  Although it’s not hot topic (like conversion attribution window), it is a mandatory process, especially for companies that have large advertising budgets and marketers who want to allocate their money in a sophisticated and efficient way. Default last-click attribution would be a good solution if users made just one interaction before they convert. Just check (into your Google Analytics) your users’ type allocation (returning vs new visitors) and realize that for each returning visitor there are at least 2 touch points, which means that if we use last-click attribution we’ll lose minimum 50% of the conversion value overall.  Yes, at least half of the conversion value (best case scenario), gone. Now, imagine that you have 10 interactions before a conversion and you will realize that you lost 90% (!) of the conversion value overall. I am not going to re-invent the wheel about attribution models, Avinash made our day easier about them with this comprehensive article, providing all the necessary information about default attribution models (along with their pros & cons) and his preferred custom attribution model as well. I just want to share a different point of view based on personal learnings about marketing attribution models. If you don’t want to create your own custom attribution model, I would suggest selecting Time Decay attribution model (click-only). Adding time dimension within an attribution model make it more “human” because it doesn’t rely only on clicks (which on mobile can be accidental clicks) and impressions (which most probably are not viewable).  This model is useful for digital touchpoints that drive conversions AND touchpoints that increase the likelihood of a conversion in the near future. Please double check and confirm your lookback window before you implement this model. The time decay factor (click-only) calculated as follows: TDF is defined by two things: (1) the time span the interaction is away from the conversion x and (2) the time decay parameter p. The smaller p is, the quicker the value of the TDF decreases with increasing distance of the interaction event from the conversion. There are a lot of custom models out there (from “bathtub model” to this “mind-blowing” model) but most of the times we have to create our own attribution model in order to meet our needs and solve our problems. If we want to create our own attribution model we need to consider the following:  Time lag We need to check the time lag of our conversions in order to add it in our attribution model. A big-time lag means that the user needs more time to convert, so the initial touchpoints don’t influence him equally with touchpoints that are closer to conversion (avoid time periods with seasonality, for more relevant results). For more information about time lag data check here.  Path Length Path length is critical. Along with time lag will help us define our approach. If the main time lag and page length are big (ex. 90 days – 4+ touchpoints), then we should consider giving more credit to touchpoints that are close to final conversion.  If the main path length and time lag are small (ex. 3 days – 2 touchpoints) then we can maybe split equally the conversion value because all touchpoints matter almost the same.  Interaction types/Engagement adjustments “Click” interaction type is the most useful since Google Analytics does not track impressions and rich media interactions from other channels besides Google products. You can add impressions to your attribution model and specify the relationship between general impression weighting and relative time weighting.  Finally, add user engagement metrics and distribute credit proportionally based on page depth rather than time on site. As Jeff Sauer said in Digital Elite Camp 2017: “When it comes to attribution models, there is no silver bullet”.  The question “which channels are better for awareness” can be answered by first-click model while the question “which channels are better for closing deals” can be answered by last-click.  If you are savvy enough, you can answer more complicated answers (for example you can check specific AdWords campaigns and non-direct user paths performance), using custom models that will give you a clear view of your users’ behavior. If you use Google Analytics Premium you have 2 additional tools that you can use, ROI Analysis & Model Explorer (both in Beta). The model explorer displays the weighted average value for path positions prior to conversion for each channel based on data-driven attribution model.  I believe that this model works by identifying patterns among those leads that lead to conversions. From the report above we can see that while paid search and display help users initially connect with the website, referral, organic search & direct are close to the end of the conversion path. All models above are very good for digital marketing but when it comes to offline channels they are useless. A good approach that can help us attribute our budget efficiently across offline marketing is exit poll and NPS.  Exit poll is a window that is displayed after a placed order (depending on the industry, it is displayed on every order or on the 1st order of every user) and simply asks the user which channel helped him learn about our company. Exit poll is a good tool to allocate orders in channels but when it comes to high-value and low-value customers it is lacking depth and sophistication so we can implement NPS technique as well. NPS (which means Net Promoter Score) ask users how likely is to recommend our product to other users and can be asked immediately after exit poll.  One good strategy for companies that have both offline & online marketing channels is to include all channels in Exit poll and then correlate GA data along with exit poll and NPS in order to create a solid attribution framework. All models have pros and cons. Digital models lack cross-device tracking, while offline models don’t have 100% answer rate. Attribution modeling is a complex project for marketing professionals but none underestimate its value.  Try to track all your channels (online and offline),  check a couple of models and their results and come up with something that will help you understand where performance and high-value customers are coming from even though you don’t have all the data in place.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/extra-mile, Extra Mile,"Extra Mile I read a great story by Benjamin Hardy on Medium, and I would like to share it with his kind permission: A farmer had grown old and was ready to pass his farm down to one of his two sons.  When he brought his sons together to speak about it, he told them: The farm will go to the younger son. The older son was furious! “What are you talking about?!” he fumed.  The father sat patiently, thinking. “Okay,” the father said, “I need you to do something for me. We need more stocks. Will you go to Cibi’s farm and see if he has any cows for sale?” The older son shortly returned and reported, “Father, Cibi has 6 cows for sale.”  The father graciously thanked the older son for his work. He then turned to the younger son and said, “I need you to do something for me. We need more stocks. Will you go to Cibi’s farm and see if he has any cows for sale?”  The younger son did as he was asked. A short while later, he returned and reported, “Father, Cibi has 6 cows for sale. Each cow will cost 2,000 rupees. If we are thinking about buying more than 6 cows, Cibi said he would be willing to reduce the price to 100 rupees. Cibi also said they are getting special jersey cows next week, if we aren’t in a hurry, it may be good to wait. However, if we need the cows urgently, Cibi said he could deliver the cows tomorrow.”  The father graciously thanked the younger son for his work. He then turned to the older son and said, “That’s why your younger brother is getting the farm.”  Moral of the story: Every time you want to do something, you should care enough in order to create something better than a decent project. Every time you have a request from a stakeholder, you need to “own” the request and create the best version of it and not just “serve” it according to stakeholders’ specs.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/a-typical-pm-day, A typical PM day,"A typical PM day Discussing with Product Managers (PMs) who are ready to go on vacation today, I realized the wide variety of tasks that a PM must handle. Below is a generalized, domain-agnostic list, including tasks that may occur within a typical day of a Product Manager:  Disclaimer: The following list include activities where the PM is solely responsible to deliver them and other activities that he is part of the team that works on it. Also, not all activities happen in a daily basis.  [Discovery] Understand domain's performance Every PM has Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It's essential to check them daily to understand how they are performing, recognize patterns, and identify seasonal variations. Generally, the best way to gauge progress is to monitor it closely. KPIs are useful indicators of what has occurred. Ideally, you should document what happened and why it occurred in your knowledge base. This information can be useful the next time you need answers for your KPIs.  [Discovery] Review customer feedback You should establish processes to regularly gather feedback from your customers. This can be through methods like Net Promoter Score (NPS), sentiment analysis, surveys, interviews, or other sources that provide context about how your customers feel about your product. Though we may have KPIs and numbers, qualitative data is essential to understand why something happened. After all, your customer is the most important stakeholder.  [Discovery] Problem understanding Understanding the problems you're trying to solve is core to your daily responsibilities. Sometimes, you may be able to tackle problems without technical implementation, such as by collaborating with another department or avoiding quick fixes that only alleviate the problem and create technical or design debt.  [Discovery] Work on solution with designers PM sit along with designer to draft the solution space. Depending on the challenge, developers are also involved. There are cases where stakeholders are involved as well.  [Discovery] Work on an analysis with analysts PM should initiate an analysis, most usually to measure the impact of a product change we developed in the last sprint.  [Discovery] Competition check & benchmarking Do not forget the competition. Study them, subscribe to their newsletter, use their product. You should always be informed regarding their best features, what are you missing, what are they missing and how can you outperform them.  [Planning] Daily standup Daily standup meetings are a common ritual where PMs gather with their team to discuss: We use Geekbot for our daily standups and highly recommend it.  [Planning] Product Planning We plan our work in a weekly basis. Although technical sprints occur every 2 weeks, there is a weekly product alignment where we discuss both downstream & upstream stories across the department. When it comes to upstream and weekly planning, there are 3 statuses: PRODUCT INPUT: Tasks that are under product discovery. TECHNICAL REFINEMENT: After discovery is completed, stories get detailed technical feedback. READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION: Stories that are ready for implementation.  [Planning] PRD writing  We create PRDs for main features. These documents require time and alignment with business and tech teams, but they serve as a reliable information source for all teams. A well-written PRD can reduce the number of necessary meetings and accelerate development and story writing & splitting.  [Planning] OKR planning Objectives and Key Results (OKR) planning requires monthly input for updates or creation of new OKRs for the upcoming quarter.  [Planning] Meetings We spend a lot of hours on meetings. There are a lot of meeting types, alignment for a new feature, planning rituals, feedback meetings etc.  [Planning] Stakeholders management Stakeholders may have needs, problems, or ideas that they would like to discuss with you.  [Planning] Communication & collaboration Every PM spends time on communication and collaboration, engaging with:  [Delivery] A/B testing review PMs should access and evaluate active A/B tests, as it's their responsibility to decide how to proceed.  [Delivery] QA contribution Often, PMs contribute to Quality Assurance (QA). There might be specific features or flows where the PM must approve before going live.  [Delivery] Epic split & story Writing After completing the PRD, we need to break down the epic into tasks (stories) and assign them to respective teams.  [Delivery] Monitor technical releases (Production) Stay informed about what your team or connected teams have released into production. This information helps you understand your current product development cycle and provides context for what has happened. Many PMs check releases through tools like JIRA or Slack.  [Team] Hiring You may be involved in sourcing, evaluating assessments, and conducting interviews to expand your team with suitable candidates.  [Team] Decision-making Decisions must often be made quickly.  [Team] Problem solving & feedback Problems requiring your contribution may arise. Examples include:  Do I miss any other important PM activity?  Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not necessarily express the views or opinions of my employer."

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/workshop-review-ai-for-senior-pms, [Review] AI worskhop for Senior PMs,"[Review] AI worskhop for Senior PMs In June, an engaging workshop took place, hosted by Marily Nika, a Greek Product leader with a wealth of experience in AI, having worked for companies like Meta and Google.  Honestly, the title and its focus on senior Product Managers caught my eye, so I decided to participate. The workshop indeed attracted many senior PMs. Although it provided a great networking opportunity, I missed out on this aspect since I didn't watch the entire live workshop but only 50% of it (the rest 50% I watched it on my own pace). Consequently, I wasn't engaged in the discussions that occurred within the workshop and on the Discord server.  After revisiting the educational content last week, I wanted to write a brief review about the workshop. The workshop consisted of 6 sessions, addressing a broad spectrum of AI topics. I'll break down the learnings into key categories to cover the essential parts:  Introduction:  Technical:  Career:  Overall, the workshop was fascinating, covering vital areas for aspiring AI PMs. Marily proved to be an engaging instructor who resonated well with the audience and communicated essential information effectively. Her hands-on experience in AI enriched the entire session, especially during the career segment, where she offered invaluable insights on becoming a PM, current recruiting trends, and dos and don'ts for AI PMs. There were even mock AI PM interview questions and answers!  Regarding feedback, I wished for more analysis and teardown of a few successful AI products, explaining why they succeeded and how to build a successful product, would have been enlightening. This is relevant today as numerous tools and startups focus on AI, but evaluating their market value and market fit can be challenging. Also, providing more technical sessions and examples (such as fine-tuning a model) would be really helpful for the PMs because if you understand the whole process, you will become a more competent AI PM.  Last but not least, the sessions featured valuable presentations from other respected professionals in the field. These were particularly insightful as some experts were senior AI PMs who shared valuable tips based on their experience. Additionally, there were experts who, while not PMs themselves, work closely with PMs. They provided advice on what they expect from a competent AI PM, as well as what they don't expect. These diverse perspectives added depth and practical understanding to the content of the workshop.  The course is recommended for senior PMs that want to break into AI.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/the-curse-of-knowledge, The curse of knowledge,"The curse of knowledge In my daily work, I collaborate with various professionals: from finance experts and accountants to software developers, designers, and marketing specialists. Each is a master in their respective domains.  While product managers are also specialists, the realm of Product thrives on a ""generalist"" ethos. Today, I want to shed light on a prevalent misconception often observed when interacting with experts: the ""Curse of Knowledge"". I first recognized this in myself when attempting to describe Product management to an individual unfamiliar with the sector.  The ""Curse of Knowledge"" is a cognitive bias. It arises when individuals deeply versed in a topic struggle to see it from the perspective of those less informed. Essentially, once you've internalized a piece of knowledge, it becomes challenging to recall not knowing it.  This cognitive situation can obstruct clear communication, project explanations, and alignment. When a knowledgeable person presumes others possess the same background understanding, they risk creating confusion or a sense of exclusion.  The Famous Experiment from ""Made to Stick"" In ""Made to Stick"", authors Chip and Dan Heath reference a study led by Elizabeth Newton in 1990. Participants were categorized as ""tappers"" or ""listeners"". Tappers would relay recognizable tunes, such as ""Happy Birthday"", using table taps, while listeners tried to identify the melodies. Although tappers anticipated a 50% success rate for the listeners, a mere 2.5% identified the songs. This experiment vividly illustrates the Curse of Knowledge: the tappers found it difficult to dissociate their comprehensive awareness of the song from the rudimentary taps.  (such a great example to explain curse of knowledge)  How to Spot It:  How to Deal with It:  In Product management, effective communication is more than important.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/a-hiring-question, A hiring question,"A hiring question When it comes to crafting questions for hiring, many guides are tailored to specific professions. Whether hiring performance marketers, BI analysts, product designers, product managers, owners, specialists, or analysts, there is one question I pose to all candidates, regardless of their level or expertise.  What are the reading pieces you have read so far that have influenced you the most?  I was first asked this question when I was being interviewed for the efood Marketing team by George Giannakeas. It's a fairly straightforward question. It's generic, timeless, and applicable to anyone. Of all the questions I've asked in interviews, this one has proven to be very helpful across various contexts.  🚨 Survivorship bias alert: I can only speak to the performance of the people we have hired, so my conclusions are based on this information alone.  ⚠️ Disclaimer: This question was part of a comprehensive process that helped us form an opinion about a candidate. It's not a magic solution, and it shouldn't be used as the sole determining question, but rather as a complementary one.   Why this question was helpful: Better understanding the candidate's mindset. Professionals come in many forms. Some are more suited to corporate environments, while others thrive in startups. They may be strong in B2B or B2C, or be managers, doers, or both. A résumé may reveal many professional traits, but many people don't necessarily work in jobs that align with their thinking. However, what a person reads can undoubtedly resonate with their mindset.  Gaining additional insights from the discussion sparked by suggestions. Often, the interview becomes more engaging due to a thought-provoking article or a piece that holds significant value. Talking about the industry rather than ourselves can be a useful tactic to understand how a candidate views the job landscape.  Discovering something interesting to read myself. Though I am an avid reader, I haven't read everything, so I might find a fascinating piece of information that could help me become a better professional.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/lead-by-example, Lead by example,"Lead by example I enjoy reading books and articles about leadership and management styles. I find the stories behind leadership lessons captivating, and it's remarkable to me how leadership patterns span across industries, from sports (e.g., ""The Score Takes Care of Itself"") to military (e.g., ""Extreme Ownership""). Additionally, I appreciate engaging in conversations with leaders based in Greece who successfully guide teams, businesses, and even volunteer organizations.  The one style that I find most compelling, and of which I am the biggest advocate, is the following:  Do you want a data-driven team? Become the most data-driven professional on the team. Do you want a disciplined team? Become the most disciplined professional. Do you want your team to thrive? You should raise the bar yourself first. Do you want a team of professionals that don’t seek excuses and drama? Avoid excuses and drama yourself first.  This is a simple and self-explanatory style. Become the compass that points in the direction you believe in and the rest of the team will follow.  Construct a system based on the principles that you believe matter to you, your team, and the business, and stubbornly follow to it. Others will follow, and those who don’t want to follow will become obsolete due to the system and the environment that the rest of the team will cultivate.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/the-inertia-law, The inertia law,"The inertia law Imagine you've decided to make a change. But, even after this decision, things don't shift overnight. This isn't because people don't want to change; it's mostly because of inertia.  Change takes time, especially for us humans. Even if we're on board with a new idea, we still need time to:  For instance, when as Marketing team (long time ago) chose to use Agile in our Scrum process, we didn't get it right immediately. It took three months to roll it out. Eventually we built our own process (Nero) that required three years to refine it to really suit us.  We used to optimize our product development towards conversion funnel optimization. 9 out of 10 tasks and features was about this funnel. But enhancing the experience after a purchase? That took more time and effort.  Customers feel inertia, too. Think about when a popular brand updates its logo. I can't recall a major logo change that everyone liked right off the bat.  And when it comes to new or revamped features in products, customers need a beat. They might even appreciate the change, but adjusting their habits? Thanks to inertia, that's a gradual process.  So, whenever you're changing something that affects how people interact, always keep inertia in mind. It's a gentle reminder that patience is key.

This concentration honed my skills in several pivotal concepts, including: These concepts proved invaluable for my progression in the product domain. Fortunately, my existing expertise in these areas made it easier for me to grasp marketing challenges and proactively design superior solutions.  I'd advise against starting directly as a PM. The most accomplished PMs I've encountered didn't begin their careers as PMs. Instead, many initiated their journeys as:  Each of these roles can pave the way to becoming an exceptional PM. They equip you with a unique perspective and specialized knowledge, both of which can significantly impact your organization.  An often-overlooked benefit from my marketing days was my role as a stakeholder. I was on the ""other side"", striving to convey the significance of my requests to the Product/Tech teams. Having been a stakeholder is invaluable for a PM. It fosters a genuine understanding and empathy towards others in different departments seeking your support. Trust me, empathizing with a stakeholder's position is entirely different when you've been in their shoes.

https://kgiamalis.co/blog/essay-what-is-a-good-conversion-rate, [Guide] What is a good conversion rate? ,"[Guide] What is a good conversion rate?  Table of content Conversion rate (aka CVR) is one of the most popular performance metrics, especially for digital platforms. Simply put, it’s the ratio of transactions to sessions, expressed as a percentage. For example, a ratio of 10 transactions out of 100 sessions would be expressed as a conversion rate of 10%.  At first glance, its popularity is reasonable because it is one metric that includes both input and output data. That’s why is one of my favorite metrics.  A platform with 300 transactions per month might be optimized or not but a platform with 40% conversion rate is generally considered as a high-performance platform (yes, there are high-volume platforms that generate 25%+ conversion rates). Moreover, most of the Marketing professionals use conversion rate in performance marketing reporting, so it makes perfect sense to expand its usage to platform performance as well. Although it is widely used, conversion rate as a metric has some challenges and traps that you need to know before you create your first report for your boss, your investor or for yourself. We use Google Analytics for our conversion rate reporting, so most of the learnings I’ll share are GA-related. Also, even though I work in the marketplace industry, the challenges below are relevant for many industries that use conversion rate in their reporting foundation. In order to avoid exposing sensitive data, I will use datasets from Google Merchandise Store or other datasets without timelines. Although many Product Marketing professionals are savvy with the usage of conversion rate as an optimization metric, few of them truly understand how tracking works. Especially in big companies, tracking implementation and maintenance is the responsibility of the Tech or Analytics team, so many Product Managers are not even aware of the setup schema. One of the biggest misconceptions regarding conversion rate is that is measuring performance at user level. Actually, even user-level data are just cookies in a browser. So a user that uses two browsers has two cookies, so within Google Analytics it is considered as two different users. There are ways to tackle this, but they are too technical so they are irrelevant to this blog post. Here is a brief explanation of how Google Analytics tracking works and here is an explanatory article for more details. Conversion rate is calculated using “sessions” and not “users” from GA. In order to highlight the difference, we’ll use a dataset to calculate conversion rate using “users” and “sessions” data. Applying the conversion rate formula using “users” data, (which is in the first row of the report which may confuse people that are not aware of the difference between “users” and “sessions”) 2,178/18,057×100 = 12% conversion rate Now, we apply the formula with the right numbers using “sessions” instead of “users” data, just for validation purposes: 2,178/24,507×100 = 8,89% conversion rate. This means that here we have more than 3% conversion rate discrepancy (in absolute numbers). Quick example: Imagine that 2 days before the calculation we made an improvement on our website speed by 1 second. Now we calculate our conversion rate using “users data” and we see a 3% increase. According to this post, our speed optimization correlates 100% with the (false) increase, so we increased our performance by optimizing website speed! Also, according to this post again, every time we improve our speed by 100ms we increase our revenue 1% so according to our report we improved our website by 1 second (10x100ms) which means that we are expecting an increase of more than 10% in our revenue! Note: This is a farfetched example, using wrong correlations along with tracking issues and an overall misunderstanding of how we should do a data-driven evaluation. I hope that this is the first (and the last) time that you see something like this! Although practically, transactions and purchases are the same, you can see that there are two ways of measurement within GA demo account. The first one is eCommerce tracking (transactions) while the second one is Goal tracking (Purchase completed). This is happening for a number of reasons. One of those reasons is the cross-validation of eCommerce tracking. This means that you can quickly check if eCommerce measurement is working correctly.  Another reason is that if eCommerce tracking brakes, we will still have the goal tracking in place so we will not miss any transactions. But the main difference between transactions and goals is that within a session a goal can be triggered only once even if you complete this goal twice or more. If you check the number of transactions and the number of goals for the same time period, you will notice that there is a discrepancy between those numbers. This discrepancy in the GA demo account example is 4.57%. If your platform has millions of transactions though, even a 4% discrepancy might lead to completely false numbers.  Always check discrepancies between goal setup, eCommerce transactions and your database transactions to ensure that you have a healthy reporting pipeline. This phenomenon doesn’t occur only with conversion rate but with many metrics, as well. As Avinash Kaushik says “All data in aggregate is crap”. Aggregated data may provide a quick overview but they may hide information that can lead to false insights. We’ll use the same example as above: As you can see the overall e-commerce conversion rate is 3.67%. If you check the percentages of each channel you will realize that these numbers vary in deviation, from 0.03% to 8.89%. Also, their weight varies as well, from 44K sessions to 323 and 1 transaction to 2K. So, the aggregate number of 3.67% does not represent clearly the performance state of the platform. You need to apply the right segmentation to be relevant and create useful insights. Platforms that have high release tempo and do multiple code changes within a day have to embrace strict QA processes to avoid potential tracking issues. Here, I want to share a bizarre example that I faced in my previous job. I had to prepare a report for a client of ours, here you can see a daily performance report of conversion rate per hour. At first glance, it seems ok but then I checked some customer care reports and I noticed that we had 30 minutes downtime within the day. Can you spot the downtime? What about now? The downtime happened from 14:05 until 14:35. But as you can see, the ratio between sessions and transactions that occurred from 14:00 to 14:05 and from14:35 to 15:00 was 12% which is a normal hourly conversion rate for this type of site.  This is happening because when a website is down, Google Analytics is not measuring any sessions or transactions as well. Tracking issues can cause massive problems to your reporting so please be aware and always cross-check your data before you publish your report. One of the most important technique in terms of budget allocation and performance is Marketing attribution understanding. I already wrote a post about attribution models but it seems that most of the professionals don’t believe that they should explore other attribution models, rather than last-click attribution. This method is so undervalued that it hasn’t even traction in Google search! The default attribution model of Google Analytics is last-click which means that the last step of user experience within the last 30 days will get 100% of conversion value.  So, if your user visit your homepage 10 times, only the last visit before the order will get a conversion value of 1 while all other visits will get 0. Let’s visualize it: Now let’s check the model that Google uses as a default in non multi-channel funnels reports, which means the reports that you see in your dashboards. As Google inform us ” The Last Non-Direct Click model ignores direct traffic and attributes 100% of the conversion value to the last channel that the customer clicked through from before buying or converting. Analytics uses this model by default when attributing conversion value in non-Multi-Channel Funnels reports. “ Let’s visualize it again: Here we see that even when the last visit was direct, the conversion value went entirely to Facebook because it was the last non-direct one. Different methodology leads to different report, which leads to different results, which lead to different insights, which lead to different decisions.  Some of the challenges above may see minor, but in hyper-growth platforms with multi-million conversions these minor changes can lead to completely irrelevant results. Besides technical understanding, a Product Manager should have strong business acumen to understand the context behind the numbers. Without context, you can’t produce insights, because the numbers can tell you what happened but they can’t tell you why it happened. Someone asked me “Do you need business or product acumen?”. In most of the cases I have faced so far, business understanding was the key to unlock most of the valuable insights, simply because our business depends entirely on our product, so in our case product performance means business performance. In many industries and businesses, product acumen means business acumen. Even if your analysis includes segmented conversion rate based on devices, conversion rate per channel, month over month and year over year comparison, and all other relevant segmentations and drill-downs, having only conversion rate metrics in an analysis can be very tricky and misleading. Here is an interesting example: In this comparison, we compare equal time ranges and we see that although the conversion rate increased by 16.59% (note here, that GA presents relative and not absolute numbers), the actual conversions skyrocketed by 77.44%.  If we didn’t check the orders, we would miss that important information. Also, with this example, we understand that conversion rate and orders have no linear correlation. If only we could assume that if we increase our sessions by 10x we will get 10x more orders! Then the company with the biggest budget would win the competition which although sometimes is happening, it’s not a given. Let’s check another example: Here we see the performance of each channel. Let’s compare row #3 to row #4. Channel in row #3 [Paid Search] has almost equal conversion rate with the channel in row #4 [Organic Search], their difference is only 0.7%. Now, if we check their transactions though, we see that the channel in row #3 has 30x fewer transactions although it has a bigger conversion rate. The difference is huge. The reason why channels have different performance and they always will is that every channel behavior is different. The user purchase intention, the targeting capabilities and the potential of each channel vary and we need to spend a significant amount of money and time in order to understand how each channel can contribute more to our channel mix and how we can effectively spend our budget. Last but not least. Segment your performance. I repeat: Segment your performance. There is no such thing as “what is your product’s conversion rate”.  Which conversion rate of all?  Conversion rate per platform?  Conversion rate per medium?  Conversion rate per campaign?  Asking for a single metric, is one of the ways to understand that the one that asks for it has no context around the number. Every time conversion rate drops, you need to understand why that happened and design the right solution. Although this is a straightforward process, there is a big number of drop-off reasons that are not related to the Product.  In the digital industry, every department affects platform performance. Although I describe Sales, Operations and Marketing issues even Finance (high prices) and Legal department (grey policies) can influence conversion rate indirectly.  Sales & Operations  This is a brief overview that describes the conversion path of an online food delivery platform. The green arrows mean that the user is moving towards the order, while the red arrows are reasons for the user to abandon our service.  Drop-off reasons from a marketplace platform could be a separate blog post on its own but here are some of the most common ones that are related to Sales and Operation teams.  Marketing  Besides Sales and Operation team issues, here I want to talk about the Marketing impact on conversion rate. I will enrich the flow above with the incoming sources, describing some of the channels that customers use in order to visit our platform.  There are some channels that are not Marketing related (Direct traffic), others that are joined efforts between Product and Marketing (Organic traffic) but most of the other sources are handled by Marketing teams.  So a large amount of sessions, one of the two metrics that help us calculate conversion rate, is handled by the Marketing team. If the Marketing team fails to optimize channel performance, it will directly affect the conversion rate of the platform. If the Marketing team allocates more budget to high-performance channels, the conversion rate will go up, even if we don’t make a single change within our product. If the Marketing team forgets to add UTM tracking in campaigns that can’t be identified automatically (example: an advertising blog post in a high-volume news website), direct traffic conversion rate will go down. I added this pie chart to make my point clearer. This is an overview of top channels that drive traffic to Google Merchandise Store. Sessions from social media (besides dark social), paid search, affiliates and display which are considered pure Marketing channels are responsible for 24% of total traffic. Almost, one out of four sessions.  This is big.  To continue on this, take a look at the performance of each channel, for simplicity reasons I will include only channels aggregated data. In our example, although Marketing channels are responsible for 24% of total traffic, they contribute only 3% on total transactions. Besides what is happening within our company, there are industry leverages that have a positive or negative impact on conversion rate. Some of them are:  Seasonality  Most of the industries have good periods and bad periods. These periods can be weeks, days or even hours. They can also be weather-related (raining, snowing, etc.) or other special occasions that have a high correlation with your industry and the solutions that you provide. At the peak of a good period, many users with strong purchase intention are flocking to your platform. If they find what they want, conversion rate will skyrocket, if they don’t, conversion rate will sink. A nice example of seasonality for e-commerce is Black Friday.  Personally speaking, my most challenging seasonality period is Easter. As you can understand, it’s very challenging because it’s not fixed (it changes every year) and its effect spans throughout many days before and after Easter day. Let’s see an example with data now:  We use transactions and e-commerce conversion rate at day level in order to produce the graph below: Since the data are at day-level (you can see it on the top right of the image) we can easily identify that there are specific days in each week that transactions are relatively low.  Competition  Competition efforts are affecting your business overall, therefore they impact your conversion rate as well. By the time your competitors push aggressively with discounts, vouchers, and promotions most probably you will suffer a negative impact that can be either short-term (your users will try the other service but they will return to you) or long-term (your users will try the other service and stick with it). Let’s start this chapter with practical advice that relies on a philosophical concept. Now, we assume that a 20% conversion rate is considered a great one. What about 19.99%? This is great as well. Now, what about 19.98%? This sounds great too. With this technique, there is no single percentage that will distinguish a great conversion rate from a normal or a bad one. This concept called “Sorites Paradox” which concludes that there are no clear boundaries between fixed terms. That’s the main reason that we prefer terms like “better” or “worse” rather than “good” or “bad”. As I said above, if your answer in the question “what is your conversion rate?” is a single number then you are missing the point of this metric.  You need to have the right segmentation framework in place to better understand your product performance and identify potential challenges or opportunities.  Segmentation though, is not a binary concept. It has a spectrum. As every spectrum, you should avoid the edges. Single conversion rate is not helpful but a report that includes conversion rates for 30 dimensions is a disaster. Also, you should be savvy enough in order to navigate along the spectrum.  If a C-level executive asks about conversion rates you should present a concise and representative report but if you want to optimize your platform’s performance you should check every dimension that matters. The ability to navigate through levels and provide the right reports to the right people in my humble opinion is one of the skills that separates senior from junior product managers. There is a principle in Analytics called “Occam’s razor” (any Avinash fans here?).  This problem-solving principle states that it’s good to explain a phenomenon by the simplest hypothesis possible.  It may sound cliche, but it’s very challenging to keep it simple, because simplicity is not always objective. Occam’s razor principle and countless hours spent in analysis led us to create the foundational set of metrics and dimensions of our conversion rate reporting.  These dimensions & metrics are one of the best to start your conversion rate report.  I personally use this set in other industries and businesses performance audits as well. It’s definitely not the holy grail but you can try it and let me know if you find it useful. This set of dimensions & metrics is suitable for the Product and Marketing overview. I will briefly describe why we use those dimensions and metrics.  Regarding metrics, transactions is the ideal end result for every session, there is no need for clarification.  Acquisition stands for every first order of a new user.  Acquisitions orders are one of the most important metrics for business growth.  The platform that acquires new users affordably and can retain the biggest percentage of them (again, affordably) wins the game.  Obviously, acquisitions are less than transactions so their segmentation should not be so deep as transactions.  Device performance most of the time differs. We separate devices into big buckets of website, mobile website (+ tablets), Android & iOS. The performance of each device varies for a number of reasons:  Landing page grouping stands for groups of landing pages. We group our landing pages (we have a lot) according to their type. Every group of landing pages has different behavior. Here are some examples:  Lastly, channel grouping is the way we group our Marketing channels. The performance of each channel varies greatly. I have already presented a relevant example above, please check the “conversion rate as stand-alone metric” section.  The main difference between channels is that there are channels that have high purchase intention and there are channels whose traffic is considered as “branded performance” with a relatively high conversion rate. You can use these dimensions in combination or as stand-alone. That means that you can check the conversion rate of each marketing channel or you can check the conversion rate of users that land in your mobile website’s homepage via direct source.  We start from device categories performance and dig deeper as long as there is significant traction & performance. There is no reason to check a conversion flow that lands the 0,001% of your users. Now, to put this framework in practice, I guess that the conversion rate of sessions in your iOS application that land in your homepage via direct source is significantly bigger than the conversion rate of your mobile web that lands in one of your blog posts via a Facebook ad.  Am I right? 😉 As Product Managers, when we overview our performance we use conversion rate along with transactions and/or revenue as the first step. Here is a representative set of example cases: Very healthy platform performance. Although it has a steady conversion rate, sessions & orders increase linearly.  With the right marketing spend and product optimization, it can scale significantly. We can find that kind of performance in platforms with high retention or an early-stage business with Product Market Fit. Let’s check a revenue example.  Here is the daily report we saw above in the “Seasonality” factor. In terms of transactions Thursday, Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days, while Sunday and Saturday are the worst.  But in terms of conversion rates Monday, Sunday and Wednesday are the best days. Wednesday and Sunday have a 0,12% conversion rate difference but Wednesday has almost double revenue (!). Benchmarking is one of the most popular ways to understand if your conversion rate is good or bad. According to an updated e-commerce research for 2020, the global benchmarks are between 1% and 4%.  I’ve seen many stats regarding performance but most of the time I can’t find the initial source of analysis in order to check their methodology, sampling, time ranges, data quality, statistical errors, etc.  Even the analysis that I used above, has different sources for different graphs. Long story short, except for some (most of the time paid) analyses on the web, I don’t trust the majority of the analysis and stats that are available on the web.  Here is an excellent article from CXL about marketing stats. Since we are talking about benchmarking though, a good feature that Google could add in Analytics is the benchmark of e-commerce conversion rate.  Or maybe someone else could create a service that would allow users to add their analytics data (anonymously) and get benchmark data according to their sector and industry. To sum up, regardless of all those challenges that I described above, I am a big fan of conversion rate as a metric because not only does it help us understand what is happening within our product, but also it helps us understand the big picture and gain useful business understanding that will help us find the best product solution, not according to product best practices but according to real business needs.

This involved guiding and mentoring team members, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the alignment of their efforts with the overall marketing objectives. By leveraging their expertise and facilitating their growth, we were able to drive the success of the performance marketing initiatives while nurturing a strong and cohesive team dynamic. One of my most significant managerial accomplishments was spearheading the development of an Agile framework for the entire Marketing department. Initially, we adopted Scrum in 2015, but as our team expanded, we recognized the need to adapt our approach or revert to traditional waterfall methods. To address this challenge, we created a new framework called Nero, derived from the Greek word "νερό" (meaning "water"), symbolizing its fluidity and practicality. Nero combines principles and tools from Scrum, Kanban, Scrum Nexus, and even Waterfall methods. This hybrid framework enabled us to effectively manage our growing team while maintaining agility and adaptability. With comprehensive documentation in place, and after witnessing positive results, we realized the value of sharing our process with the wider marketing community. Consequently, we decided to publish a book, available on Amazon, detailing our Nero framework. This resource is especially beneficial for marketers in large organizations undergoing transformation or marketers in startups seeking to enhance productivity and scale their teams. Whether you are a marketer in need of transformation in a big organization or a marketer in a startup looking to boost productivity and manage team growth, this book offers practical insights and strategies to support your journey. During my time in Larissa, my friend Konstantinos Malaviezos and I founded Syndesis to address the challenge of career uncertainty among young individuals. Our aim was to create a service that utilized a job orientation test to help students identify their ideal profession.  The concept behind Syndesis was simple: to develop a service that allowed students to take a job orientation test in order to identify their most suitable profession. Once the ideal job was determined, our approach involved arranging two interviews with practicing professionals in that field. If a student expressed interest in becoming a lawyer, for example, we would connect them with professional lawyers.  These interviews provided valuable opportunities for students to ask questions, gain insights into the legal profession, and understand the typical schedules and demands of lawyers. Our goal was to facilitate meaningful conversations that would equip students with firsthand information to make informed decisions about their career paths. Although we secured initial funding and gained some traction, we struggled to find the right product-market fit. Despite our efforts, we were unable to fully align our offering with the needs of our target audience. After six months, we made the tough decision to discontinue the business.  Syndesis continued for a year or more but ultimately closed due to the lack of a strong product-market fit. While the closure was disappointing, we acknowledge that it\'s common for startups to face challenges in finding the right fit in a competitive market. We consider the experience gained from Syndesis as valuable lessons for future endeavors. We believe that these lessons can contribute to the development of innovative solutions that effectively address market needs. In 2014, three of my friends and I embarked on an entrepreneurial venture and founded our own food startup called Chipple. Our business concept had two main components. Firstly, we aimed to introduce sweet fried apple chips as a healthier alternative to traditional potato chips in the snack industry. Secondly, we wanted to provide vacuum-sealed fresh fruits, primarily targeting kiosks and school/hospital canteens, to offer a healthy choice for consumers. To turn our business idea into reality, we developed a comprehensive and realistic business plan. We decided to participate in a national competition called Re-inspire Greece, with the hope of securing the necessary funding to launch our business.  To our delight, we finished in third place, securing a 50K funding round. At that time, I believed this would be the biggest and perhaps the only chance for our success.On the surface, everything seemed to be in place for our startup. Specifically: ✅ We were a young and talented team with great potential. ✅ We had secured the necessary funding to kickstart our business. ✅ We had established sales channels, thanks to a collaboration with a large Greek company, who was ready to purchase our products. However, only six months later, we made the difficult decision to quit without even launching our business. As a team, we came to the realization that bringing our products to market was more challenging than anticipated. The hurdles and obstacles we faced seemed insurmountable, and collectively, we made the choice to return to our 9-to-5 jobs. Though our entrepreneurial journey was relatively short-lived, it provided me with a valuable lesson that starting a business may appear promising on paper, but the reality can be vastly different. I took on a new and different adventure in the events industry as one of the national producers for the Greek team in StartupBus, a prestigious European startup competition held in Vienna.  Our goal was, each team that participated to launch a software service within 72 hours and compete against teams from six other European countries for a chance to participate in a San Francisco incubator. After traveling through eight countries in one week, a Greek team emerged victorious, securing the grand prize.  This experience showcased the talent and innovation of Greek startups on an international stage, reinforcing the potential of Greek entrepreneurship.

I seized an opportunity to work remotely as an associate marketing manager for a US-based agency called customedialabs. This opportunity arose through the network and skills I developed from a voluntary program I initiated in Larissa called Prosfero. At the start of my career, my primary hard skills revolved around Google Analytics and copywriting. Fortunately, these skills have remained my favorites and continue to be relevant to my work. I still utilize Google Analytics extensively in my day-to-day tasks, and I am actively engaged in writing. In today\'s digital age, writing has become an essential skill for everyone, as we devote significant time to crafting specifications, emails, chat messages, and taking notes. Therefore, copywriting skills have become indispensable for individuals in various roles and industries. One of the books that helped me a lot as professional was “Linchpin” by Seth Godin. It taught me 2 lessons: At customedialabs, I worked with big clients mostly in the Pharmaceutical industry, providing analytics insights and copywriting services. One of my highlights was an IMA award for a project that I participated in. This was my introduction to the Marketing industry and although I didn’t have the best start, I realized that this industry has all the challenges and opportunities that I am interested in. A couple of awards we won with projects that I was involved in: I occasionally share stories and knowledge as a speaker in conferences and other events such as TEDx and Product Marketing meetups. In summer 2023, I decided that it is time to start developing skills around AI.

During the challenging era of the COVID-19 pandemic, myself, Ioanna Fotopoulou, and Nastazia Tambakopoulou collaborated with the Hellenic Anti-cancer Organization to create impactful campaigns supporting those in need. Our initiative, known as ThatFeeling, involved partnering with Greek influencers to offer unique experiences through the sale of lottery tickets. With each campaign, users had the opportunity to purchase lottery tickets, and at the end of the contest, a winner was randomly selected to enjoy the special experience. Through the collaboration with 10 popular influencers, we successfully raised a significant amount of money to procure masks and medical equipment. The main objective of ThatFeeling was to combine the power of influencer collaborations and the generosity of individuals to support important causes during the pandemic. By engaging the community through these campaigns, we not only provided memorable experiences to the lucky winners but also contributed to the Hellenic Anti-cancer Organization\'s efforts in acquiring essential resources to combat the challenges posed by COVID-19. One of my most significant initiatives is Prosfero. The idea for Prosfero originated during my time in the army, where I witnessed a significant amount of food being wasted daily due to the limitations of the existing process. This experience motivated me to take action. After a year, I returned to the camp as a volunteer, collecting the surplus food and redistributing it to those in need. Prosfero began as a local initiative in Larisa, where we successfully collected approximately 2 tons of unused food each month. The collected food was then utilized to support social meals for people facing food insecurity. As the initiative grew, Prosfero evolved into an online platform-aggregator in Athens. The platform aimed to promote and connect social organizations throughout Greece, fostering collaboration and expanding their reach. This transformation allowed Prosfero to have a broader impact by connecting surplus resources with those in need on a larger scale. The success of Prosfero was recognized when it was awarded as one of the most innovative social programs in 2013 by the Angelopoulos Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative University in St. Louis, USA. This recognition further highlighted the significance and effectiveness of Prosfero in addressing food waste and supporting people in need. The journey of Prosfero exemplifies the power of grassroots initiatives and the potential for innovation in addressing social challenges. By repurposing surplus resources and fostering collaboration, Prosfero has made a meaningful difference in the lives of vulnerable individuals and communities across Greece."
